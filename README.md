# 5 Minutes Dealer – GDD 
- Game Title (Working): 5 Minute Dealer 
- Genre: 2D Arcade Stealth-Timing 
- Platform: PC (Unity) 
- Session Length: 5 minutes 
## Core Concept 
You’re a street hustler trying to make as much money as possible in 5 minutes. 
● Buyers spawn on the street → you must sell to them. 
● Police patrol the area → if they spot you mid-deal, it’s Game Over. 
● Selling requires holding a key to fill a progress bar. 
● Watch for cop warning signs and release in time to avoid suspicion. 
## Core Gameplay Loop 
1. Walk along the street (x-axis only). 
2. Find a buyer → hold E to start selling. 
3. Fill progress bar to complete the deal. 
4. Cops patrol → if they near a buyer, watch for warning signs. 
5. Release E if a cop’s about to turn. 
6. Earn money for completed sales. 
7. 5 minutes pass → final score and money shown. 
## Systems Breakdown 
1. Player 
● Movement: Left/right (A/D or arrow keys). 
● Interaction: Hold E to sell → triggers progress bar. 
2. Buyers 
● Spawn randomly on street. 
● Stay idle for X seconds before leaving. 
● If bar reaches 0 → buyer leaves unsatisfied. 
● On successful sale → despawns, adds points/coins. 
3. Pedestrians 
● Walk along street → purely cosmetic, adds life. 
4. Cops 
● Patrol on fixed or semi-random paths. 
● If near a buyer while player selling → enter “suspicious state”. 
● Show warning icon. 
● After short delay, turns to face → if player still holding → busted. 
● If no player activity → resumes patrol. 
5. Progress Bar (Selling Mechanic) 
● UI bar above player during selling. 
● Fills while holding E. 
● Drains if released early. 
● Success = full bar. 
● Fail = bar reaches 0. 
6. Score & Currency 
● Score = successful deals count (leaderboard metric). 
● Coins = currency to unlock new products in shop. 
7. Shop System 
● Between rounds: Buy stronger “products” (slower to sell, more profit). 
● First iteration: just seeds/weed → cocaine → high-class drugs (or safe placeholders like 
"basic goods → rare goods"). 
8. UI 
● In-game: Timer, Score, Coins (top bar). 
● Game Over: Final score, coins collected, Restart. 
● Shop: Simple grid of items to unlock with coins.
